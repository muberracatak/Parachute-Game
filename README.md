## Getting Started

This project is for a game written by using Javascript, HTML, CSS. The game is played by passing through the bricks on the left and right without touching them.The Main Character can move right, left, up and down. When the bricks are touched from the top, bottom or side, the game is lost and the page is refreshed and the game starts from the beginning. When it touches the bird in the game, the bird bonus counter increases. When Score is 5, the game gets faster and harder.

## Wanted to add to the project
